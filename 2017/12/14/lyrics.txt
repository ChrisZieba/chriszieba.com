Last night I was so depressed
And I went and got a Bible
And I turned to the Book of Revelations
And if people would just get, read the Bible
And read the Book of Revelations
They would really turn around and straighten up
All we need to do, to get the good book
And read it, put it to everyday life

Sisters, niggers, whities, Jews, crackers
Don't worry, if there's hell below
We're all gonna go
Ah

Sisters
Brothers and the whities
Blacks and the crackers
Police and their backers
They're all political actors

Hurry
People running from their worries
While the judge and the juries
Dictate the law that's partly flawed
Catcalling, love balling, fussing and cussing
Top billing now is killing
For peace no one is willing
Kind of make you get that feeling

Everybody smoke (everybody smoke, smoke, smoke, smoke)
Use the pill and the dope (and the dope, dope, dope, dope)
Educated fools
From uneducated schools
Pimping people is the rule
Polluted water in the pool

And Nixon talking about don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry, worry)
He say don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry, worry)
He say don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry, worry)
He say don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry, worry)

But they don't know
There can be no show
And if there's a hell below
We're all gonna go (gonna go, gonna go, gonna go, go)

Everybody praying
And everybody saying
But when come time to do
Everybody's laying

Just talking about don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry)
They say don't worry (don't worry, worry, worry)
They say don't worry (don't worry)
They say don't worry

Sisters
Brothers and the whities
Blacks and the crackers
Police and their backers
They're all political actors

Smoke (smoke)
The pill and the dope (and the dope, dope)
Educated fools
From uneducated schools
Pimping people is the rule
Polluted water in the pool

And everybody saying don't worry (don't worry, worry)
They say don't worry (don't worry, worry)
They say don't worry (don't worry, worry)
They say don't worry (don't worry, worry)

But they don't know
There can be no show
And if there's a hell below
We're all gonna go (gonna go, go)
Lord, what we're gonna do

Tell me what we gonna do
If everything I say is true
This ain't no way it ought to be
If only all the mass could see

But they keep talking 'bout don't worry
They say don't worry
They say don't worry
They say don't worryI'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share
Or how to care
I never had no teachings
About being fair

Depression is part of my mind
The sun never shines
On the other side of town
The need here is always for more
There's nothing good in store
On the other side of town

It's hard to do right
In this filthy night
Just plain simple comfort
Is completely out of sight
My little sister she hungry
For bread to eat
My brother's hand me down shoes
Are now showing his feet

Ghetto blues showed on the news
All is aware
But what the hell do they care
You across the track
Completely relaxed
You take a warning fact
Don't you never come back

I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share
Or how to care
I never had no teachings
About being fair

Depression is part of my mind
The sun never shines
On the other side of town
The need here is always for more
There's nothing good in store
On the other side of town

O baby it's hard to do right
On the other side of townA little sugar, honey suckle lamb
Great expression of happiness
Boy, you could not miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
It is true, the makings of you, oh

It's been a miracle for what you've done
Please stay right by my side
Two can be one for the righteous way to go
Anyone would know
I believe I thought I told you so
You're second to none

Love of all mankind should reflect some sign 
Of these words I'm trying to recite
They're close, but not quite
Almost impossible to do
Reciting the makings of you

The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told them so
You're second to none

The love of all mankind should reflect some sign 
Of these words I'm trying to recite
They're close, but not quite
Almost impossible to do
Reciting the makings of youWe people who are darker than blue
Are we gonna stand around this town
And let what others say come true?
We're just good for nothing they all figure

A boyish, grown up, shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at?
We people who are darker than blue

This ain't no time for segregatin'
I'm talking 'bout brown and yellow two
High yellow girl, can't you tell
You're just the surface of our dark deep well

If your mind could really see
You'd know your color the same as me
Pardon me, brother, as you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story

Get yourself together, learn to know your side
Shall we commit our own genocide
Before you check out your mind?

I know we've all got problems
That's why I'm here to say
Keep peace with me and I with you
Let me love in my own way

Now I know we have great respect
For the sister, and mother it's even better yet
But there's the joker in the street

Loving one brother and killing the other
When the time comes and we are really free
There'll be no brothers left you see

We people who are darker than blue
Don't let us hang around this town
And let what others say come true

We're just good for nothing they all figure
A boyish, grown up, shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at?

Pardon me, brother, while you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story
Pardon me, brother, I know we've come a long, long way
But let us not be so satisfied for tomorrow can be an
An even brighter dayHush now child and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you by and by
So in the mean time, move on up towards your destination
Though you may find from time to time complications

Bite your lip and take a trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip so what you wanna do
Just move on up for peace you will find
Into the steeple of beautiful people where there's only one kind

So hush now child and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you by and by
So what are we wanna do is move on up for a greater day
But just you gonna make it, you put your mind to it, you can surely do it

Take nothing less than the supreme best
Do not obey for most people say 'cause you can past the test
So what we have to do is move on up and keep on wishing
Remember your dream is your only scheme so keep on pushing

So hush now child and don't you cry
Your folks might understand you by and by
Move on up for a greater day but just you gonna make it
You put your mind to it, you can surely do it
Move on up, we can to move on up
Move on up, move on child I wanna move on up

We can to move on up, we can to move on up
We can to move on up, we can to move on up
We can to move on up, we can to move on up
We can to move on up, we can to move on up

We can to move on up, we can to move on up
We can to move on up, we can to move on up
We can to move on up, we can to move on up
We can to move on up, we can to move on up"Hello Daddy"
"Hello baby, how is my love child?"
"Fine"
"Tell me, of all your dreams, what most do you hope te be when you become a big girl?"
"Daddy, I would like to be Miss Black America"

Hurringly stepping so proud
Mother nature's only god child
Society salutes you today
And we'd like to say

God bless Miss Black America
Watch over Miss Black America
She cried tears of succes
We wish her long happiness
Miss Black America

Of that natural look we se among the crowd
World wide admiration

They love you Miss Black America
We love you too Miss Black America
You're such wonderful people
And so beautifully equal

A culture no one can deny
If a young child should ask

None other than Miss Black America
She cried tears of success
We wish her long happiness
Miss Black America
Miss Black America
We're so proud of you
Miss Black AmericaWild and free is the way I wanna be
Making a new day
Leading in a new way

Respect for those people
Power to the people
Setting down the old crew
Bringing in the brand new
Wild and free, with peace finally

Wild and free, is the way I want my life
Natures way for me
Without pain and strife

Fighting what is wrong
Across the world as well as home
But respect for everybody's right
Could be really out of sight

Our great obligations
Would not be bad situations
If the young would be listened to
For what they really know is true

Respect for those people
Power to the people
The old people who worry 'bout me
'Cause I am so wild and free

Wild and free, is the way I wanna be
Making a new day
Leading in a new way
Respect for those people
Power to the peopleIt is my theory
The two of us are somewhat leery
About the happiness
We both set out to posses

We've got all the comforts of life
A few kids and you are my wife
And I tell it like it is
I must confess

I'm gonna have to give it up
I'm gonna have to give it up

All concern and the trusts that never happened with us
The walk of embraces and the love of our faces
It never happened you see and I'm so sorry

I really truly love you
And the kids you must agree
And I never had too much
Concern or interest in astrology

But as I read it must be so
The invulnerable word incompatible
No matter how much we try
Our indifference but still show

Now we've got give it up
I'm gonna have to give it up

All concern and the trusts that never happened with us
The walk of embraces and the love of our faces
It never happened you see and I'm so sorry

Now we've got give it up, ooh child
I've got to have to give it up
Lord, have mercy
Now I've got give it up, ooh
I've got to give it up

All concern and the trusts that never happened with us
The walk of embraces and the love of our faces
It never happened you see and I'm so sorry

But now we've got to give it up
What am I do?
Child, we've got to give it up
I'll be so lonely without you
But now I've got to give it up

Lord, forgive me, ooh
I've got to give it up, ooh
Now I've got to give it up
Lord, I have to give it upGet down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural mood

Get down, baby
Your creative mood shall express itself
Get down, baby
After life and desire there is nothing left

We're all children of the world
A hungry man in search for a hungry girl
It's strange, so plain we're all cannibal
The most wasted and two faced of all animals

Get down, get down
Get down, get down

Take my soul, baby
When you reel I can feel so much desire
Take my soul, baby
Life unfolds from my soul when you start a fire

So get down, just get down

Get down, baby
As the rhythm should follow through your able soul
Get down, baby
Play the part like a pro in a perfect role

Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural mood

One can never point out the actual path
Of the mysterious need in a female's heart
Man can only follow not knowing how
His faith might erupt [Incomprehensible]

So get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down

Get down, baby
To the funky, funky, funky groove
Get down, baby
Let the light reflect upon your natural move

Take my soul, baby
Your creative mood shall express itself
Take my soul, baby
After life and desire there is nothing left

Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get down
Get down, get downEverybody gather round and listen to my song
I've only got one

We who are young, should now take a stand
Don't run from the burdens of women and men
Continue to give, continue to live
For what you know is right

Most of your life can be out of sight
Withdraw from the darkness and look to the light
Where everyone's free
At least that's the way it's supposed to be

We just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on

Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us

And there's still a lot of faith and warmth and trust
When we keep on keeping on

Before we dismiss, one thing I insist
When you have your young, remember this song
And our world surroundings, its leaps and bounds
Ups and downs, is reality

Teach them to be strong, and when they are grown
They can proudly imply that we were an all right guy
For all the wrong now is right
This nation's people are now united as one

And we just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on

Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us

And there's still a lot of faith, warmth, and trust
When we keep on keeping on

Keep on keeping on, y'all
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on
Keep on, keeping on
(Keep on, keeping on)

We got to move on up, y'all
(We got to move on up)
Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on

Some years back I remember
Still in my mind so well
My mama made this [Incomprehensible]
And I found it never fails

Never worry too long
(Worry too long)
About what goes on
(About what goes on)
Today it's sorrow
(Today it's sorrow)
Look like joy tomorrow
(Look like joy tomorrow)

Keep on keeping on
(Keep on keeping on)
Keep on, keep on
(Keep on, keep on)

We just keep on keeping on
We just keep on keeping on

Many think that we have blown it
But they too will soon admit
That there's still a lot of love among us

And there's still a lot of faith, warmth, and trust
When we keep on keeping on

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)
We're gonna move on up
(We're gonna move on up)

Keep on keeping on
(Keep on keeping on)
Move on, move now
(Move on, move now)
Keep on keeping on
(Keep on keeping on)Familiar music, familiar sound
Does mute your thoughts for the underground
Lonely sight for any turning light
Future prophesy for the [Incomprehensible]

There'll be equal stay and equal play
The underground where none can betray

The underground
The underground
The underground

There'll be no light, so there can be no sight
And you'll judge your fellow men on the stand
By what is right
They'll all turn black so who's to know
As a matter of fact: color, creed and breed must go

The underground
The underground

Familiar music, familiar sound
Does mute your thoughts for the underground
Lonely sight for any turning light
Future prophecy for the [Incomprehensible]

And then you And then you And then you And then you came along You spoiled me with (?) And now you gone And now you, you gone.Through loving you I seem to feel a spirit
Deep inside of me
Preciously guiding me
My woman of all women, dear to me

Forever love me
For I need you constantly
And still, you hold me close indeed
Helping to keep this love I need
Feels so much like your touch divine

Drinking and getting high on wine
Wanting to love you, all the time
Just love to keep you in my mind
Just love to keep you in my mind

Your face is so mysteriously kind
I bet that love is
Partial to your sign
Somehow I do believe that you are mine
Proving in a natural way
Things that I could never think to say

And still, you hold me close indeed
Helping to keep this love I need
Feels so much like your touch divine

Drinking and getting high on wine
Wanting to love you all the time
Just love to keep you in my mind
Just love to keep you in my mind

The magic that you secretly possess
Ooh, I must confess
Must be working at its best
My love for you is one you'll always know
Wherever we may go
You will find that it is so
And still, you hold me close indeed
Helping to keep this love I need
Feels so much, like your touch divine

Drinking and getting high on wine
Wanting to love you all the time
Just love to keep you in my mind
I just love to keep you in my mind
